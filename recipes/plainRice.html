<h3>Literally Just Rice</h3>

<p>
  There are three basic kinds of rice: short-grain, long-grain, and medium-grain. Among them you'll find hundreds of different varieties.

Short-grain rice is rounded and plump, with a high starch content that makes the grains stick together when cooked, especially if the rice has been milled to make white rice.

Long-grain rice is much longer than it is wide. Its lower starch content makes the cooked grains lighter, dryer, and more easily separated.

Medium-grain rice slots right between short- and long-grain rice both in shape and starchiness.
